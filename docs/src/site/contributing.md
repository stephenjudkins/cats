# Contributing

Discussion around Cats is currently happening in the
[Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/non/cats) as well as on Github
issue and PR pages. You can get an overview of who is working on what
via [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/non/cats).

Feel free to open an issue if you notice a bug, have an idea for a
feature, or have a question about the code. Pull requests are also
gladly accepted. For more information, check out the [contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

People are expected to follow the
[Typelevel Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html) when
discussing Cats on the Github page, Gitter channel, or other
venues.

We hope that our community will be respectful, helpful, and kind. If
you find yourself embroiled in a situation that becomes heated, or
that fails to live up to our expectations, you should disengage and
contact one of the [project maintainers](#maintainers) in private. We
hope to avoid letting minor aggressions and misunderstandings escalate
into larger problems.

If you are being harassed, please contact one of [us](#maintainers)
immediately so that we can support you.
